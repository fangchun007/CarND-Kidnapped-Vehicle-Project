This file explains how I implement the present version of particle filter algorithm. It also reveals my commends on the starter code of this project.

### 1. How do I set the number of particles?

Recall that the distribution of particles at any time represents the possiblility of location of the vehicle at the present time. With more detail, where there accumulates more particles, the higher possiblility for this place to be the vehicle's location. Therefore, the number of particles should depend on the following aspects.

a. the initial distribution of position of vehicle: Gaussian 
b. the dimension of the map: 2D

c. The accuracy of iteration

Here, we used a 2-D normal distribution (based on GPS measurement) as the initial distribution of the vehicle. On the other hand, since we later use measurement of distances from landmarks instead, which has not worse accuracy than GPS (in the code, they are the same), to predict the location of the vehicle, one can believe that the distribution will have higher and higher peak as time goes by. 

Sum up, we will set the number of particles num_particles = 8 * 17 = 136.

    void ParticleFilter::prediction(double delta_t, double std_pos[], double velocity, double yaw_rate).
